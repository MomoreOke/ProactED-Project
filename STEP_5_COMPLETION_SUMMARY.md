# Step 5 Completion: Advanced Dashboard Analytics

## üéØ Summary

Successfully completed Step 5 of the Predictive Maintenance System implementation roadmap, delivering comprehensive advanced analytics capabilities to the dashboard.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Advanced Analytics Endpoints

Created 5 new API endpoints in `DashboardController.cs`:

1. **`/Dashboard/GetMaintenanceCostAnalysis`**
   - Monthly maintenance cost trends
   - Equipment count correlation
   - Cost-per-equipment calculations

2. **`/Dashboard/GetEquipmentLifecycleAnalysis`**
   - Average equipment age by type
   - Failure correlation analysis
   - Lifecycle insights

3. **`/Dashboard/GetFailurePredictionTrends`**
   - Daily risk level tracking (High/Medium/Low)
   - 30-day rolling predictions
   - Trend analysis

4. **`/Dashboard/GetKpiMetrics`**
   - MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
   - MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)
   - Equipment Availability percentage
   - Overall efficiency metrics

5. **`/Dashboard/GetMaintenanceEfficiency`**
   - Preventive vs. Corrective maintenance ratios
   - Average downtime by equipment type
   - Cost efficiency analysis

### 2. Dashboard UI Enhancements

Added 5 new Chart.js visualizations to `Views/Dashboard/Index.cshtml`:

1. **Maintenance Cost Chart** (Line Chart)
   - Interactive cost trends over time
   - Hover tooltips with detailed metrics

2. **Equipment Lifecycle Chart** (Bar Chart)
   - Age distribution by equipment type
   - Color-coded based on age ranges

3. **Failure Prediction Chart** (Line Chart)
   - Risk level trends over time
   - Multi-line display for different risk levels

4. **KPI Dashboard** (Radar Chart)
   - Comprehensive performance metrics
   - Easy-to-read radar visualization

5. **Maintenance Efficiency Chart** (Multi-axis Bar Chart)
   - Dual y-axis for percentages and hours/costs
   - Comprehensive efficiency analysis

### 3. Real-time Integration

- **SignalR Hub**: `Hubs/MaintenanceHub.cs` for real-time updates
- **Auto-refresh**: Charts update every 30 seconds
- **Background Services**: Integration with existing monitoring services
- **Live Updates**: Dashboard responds to real-time maintenance events

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Model Property Fixes
- Corrected `EquipmentType.EquipmentTypeName` (was `TypeName`)
- Fixed `FailurePrediction.PredictedFailureDate` (was `PredictedDate`)
- Updated enum usage to `PredictionStatus` (was `RiskLevel`)
- Implemented null safety for navigation properties

### Chart Configuration
- Responsive design with `maintainAspectRatio: false`
- Professional color schemes and gradients
- Interactive tooltips and legends
- Proper scaling and formatting for currency and percentages

### Data Processing
- Efficient LINQ queries with proper joins
- Null-safe operations with `??` operators
- Optimized data aggregation for large datasets
- Proper async/await patterns for database operations

## üìä Analytics Capabilities Delivered

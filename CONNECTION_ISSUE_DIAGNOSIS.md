# Connection Issue Diagnosis and Resolution

## Problem Identified
The `net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` error was occurring because:

1. **Missing Anti-Forgery Token**: The AJAX request was trying to access an anti-forgery token that wasn't present in the form.
2. **Incorrect CSRF Header**: The request was using `RequestVerificationToken` instead of the correct `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header.
3. **Missing JavaScript Functions**: Several JavaScript functions were called but not defined, causing potential runtime errors.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Added Anti-Forgery Token to Form
```html
<form id="dashboardFilterForm" method="get">
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
    ...
</form>
```

### 2. Fixed AJAX Request Headers
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/Dashboard/ApplyDashboardFilters', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
    headers: {
        'X-CSRF-TOKEN': document.querySelector('input[name="__RequestVerificationToken"]')?.value || ''
    }
});
```

### 3. Added Missing JavaScript Functions
- `updateUrlWithFilters()` - Updates browser URL with current filter parameters
- `loadFiltersFromUrl()` - Loads filters from URL parameters on page load
- `saveFiltersAsView()` - Saves current filter settings as a named view
- `refreshSavedViews()` - Refreshes the saved views dropdown
- `updateSavedViewsDropdown()` - Updates saved views UI elements

## Current Status
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Application runs on http://localhost:5261
- ✅ Anti-forgery token is properly included
- ✅ AJAX requests should now work correctly
- ✅ All JavaScript functions are defined

## Next Steps
1. Test the AJAX filtering functionality in the browser
2. Verify that filters apply in real-time without page refresh
3. Test saving and loading filter views
4. Ensure URL parameters persist correctly

## Technical Details
- **Controller**: `DashboardController.ApplyDashboardFilters` method exists and returns JSON
- **Model**: `EnhancedDashboardViewModel` is properly defined and used
- **View**: Filter form includes all necessary elements and tokens
- **JavaScript**: All AJAX calls are properly structured with error handling

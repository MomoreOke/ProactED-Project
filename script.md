## Slide 1: Title
“Hello everyone, we are Team ProactED. Today we will present our Predictive Asset Management & Maintenance Platform.”

---

## Slide 2: Agenda
“Here’s our agenda: objectives, features, solution design, methodology, tools, outcomes, SDG alignment, and a demo preview.”

---

## Slide 3: Project Objectives
“We aimed to minimize downtime, optimize inventory, automate timetable-based usage tracking, and provide intuitive dashboards.”

---

## Slide 4: Key Features
“Our platform includes ML-driven failure prediction, real-time inventory alerts, PDF timetable parsing, email/in-app notifications, and robust reporting.”

---

## Slide 5: Proposed Solution
“We built an ASP.NET Core MVC backend with C#, Razor + Bootstrap frontend, EF Core for data, a Python-based ML API, and Azure Form Recognizer for PDF parsing.”

---

## Slide 6: Methodology & Workflow
“We followed an agile iterative process: requirements, design, implementation, integration of ML & Form Recognizer, thorough testing, and Azure deployment.”
“Here’s a high-level workflow of how user actions flow through our system.”

---

## Slide 7: Tools & Technologies
“We leveraged .NET 7, EF Core, Bootstrap 5, C#, Python, Azure Form Recognizer, Azure SQL, GitHub Actions, xUnit, and Postman for CI/CD and testing.”

---

## Slide 8: Expected Outcomes
“We anticipate a 20% reduction in equipment downtime, 30% savings in inventory costs, 90% automation of usage tracking, and improved stakeholder decision-making.”

---

## Slide 9: SDG Alignment
“We align with SDG 4 by providing data-driven lab scheduling insights for educational institutions, and SDG 12 by optimizing inventory to reduce waste and extending equipment life via predictive maintenance.”

---

## Slide 10: Demo Preview
“In our demo, we’ll showcase uploading a timetable PDF, viewing usage and maintenance predictions, adding stock to see live alerts, and exploring our ML dashboard with export capabilities.”

# üìã Project Abstract

## Predictive Maintenance Management System

### Executive Summary

The **Predictive Maintenance Management System** is a comprehensive web-based application designed to revolutionize equipment maintenance operations through data-driven insights and intelligent automation. Built using modern web technologies including ASP.NET Core 9.0, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server, this system provides organizations with a robust platform for managing equipment lifecycle, predicting failures, and optimizing maintenance schedules.

### Project Overview

In today's industrial landscape, unplanned equipment downtime can result in significant financial losses, safety hazards, and operational disruptions. Traditional reactive maintenance approaches are costly and inefficient, while purely preventive maintenance can lead to unnecessary interventions and resource waste. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a sophisticated predictive maintenance solution that leverages historical data, maintenance patterns, and equipment analytics to forecast potential failures and optimize maintenance activities.

// This file has been removed as part of Option B implementation
// The unified Asset Management system uses separate Equipment and InventoryItem models
// with a unified presentation layer through AssetController and view models.

// Please close this file and do not use it.
// The actual models are:
// - Equipment.cs (for equipment assets)
// - InventoryItem.cs (for inventory/stock items)
// - UnifiedAssetViewModels.cs (for unified presentation)

## Azure Form Recognizer Integration Summary

### What was implemented:

1. **FormRecognizer Service Integration**:
   - Added `IFormRecognizerService` and `FormRecognizerService` 
   - Configured Azure Form Recognizer client in `Program.cs`
   - Added `TableResult` and `TableCell` models for structured data

2. **EquipmentController Integration**:
   - Injected `IFormRecognizerService` into constructor
   - Modified `ProcessDocumentUploads` method to extract tables from PDF documents
   - Logs table extraction results for each uploaded manufacturer document

3. **TimetableController Integration**:
   - Injected `IFormRecognizerService` into constructor  
   - Enhanced `ProcessTimetableFile` to use both text extraction and table extraction
   - Created new `ParseTimetableData` method that combines text and table parsing
   - Added `ParseTimetableTables` method with intelligent room/time pattern matching

### Key Features:

- **Equipment Documents**: Automatically extracts tables from uploaded manufacturer documents (PDFs)
- **Timetable Processing**: Uses both traditional text parsing and structured table extraction
- **Smart Pattern Matching**: Recognizes room codes (e.g., PB001, LAB203) and time ranges (e.g., 09:00-11:00)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Falls back to text-only parsing if table extraction fails
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of extraction results for debugging

### Usage:

1. **Equipment Creation with Documents**: 
   - Upload PDF manufacturer documents in Equipment > CreateWithDocs
   - Tables are automatically extracted and logged

2. **Timetable Upload**:
   - Upload semester timetable PDFs in Timetable > Upload  
   - System uses both text and table extraction for better accuracy
   - Extracted data maps room usage to equipment automatically

### Configuration Required:

Make sure to set these values in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "FormRecognizer": {
    "Endpoint": "https://your-region.cognitiveservices.azure.com/",
    "ApiKey": "your-api-key-here"
  }
}
```

The integration is now live and will enhance document processing capabilities across the application!

    // New critical metrics
    public int CriticalAlerts { get; set; }
    public int OverdueMaintenances { get; set; }
    public int EquipmentNeedingAttention { get; set; }
    
    // New contextual data
    public List<Equipment>? CriticalEquipment { get; set; }
    public List<QuickAction>? SuggestedActions { get; set; }
}

public class QuickAction
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public string Icon { get; set; }
    public string Controller { get; set; }

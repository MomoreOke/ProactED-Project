# üîß API Development Status

## Step 4: REST API Creation - **IN PROGRESS**

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks:
1. **JWT Authentication Setup**
   - ‚úÖ Added JWT Bearer token authentication to `Program.cs`
   - ‚úÖ Added JWT configuration to `appsettings.json`
   - ‚úÖ Installed `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package

2. **Swagger/OpenAPI Integration**
   - ‚úÖ Installed `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` package
   - ‚úÖ Added Swagger configuration with JWT support
   - ‚úÖ Configured Swagger UI at `/api-docs` endpoint

3. **API Infrastructure**
   - ‚úÖ Created `Controllers/Api/` directory structure
   - ‚úÖ Configured JSON serialization options for circular references

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues:
1. **Model Mismatch**: The API controllers were built with incorrect assumptions about the data models:
   - Equipment model uses `EquipmentId` instead of `Id`
   - Equipment doesn't have `Name`, `SerialNumber`, `PerformanceScore` properties
   - MaintenanceLog model structure is different (`LogId`, `LogDate`, `Technician`, etc.)
   - InventoryItem uses `ItemId` and different property names
   - User model doesn't have `Role` property as expected

2. **Navigation Properties**: The actual navigation properties don't match what was coded in the API controllers

### üîÑ Next Steps:

#### **Option A: Fix Existing API Controllers (Recommended)**
1. **Analyze all models** to understand the correct structure
2. **Rewrite API controllers** to match actual model properties
3. **Update DTOs** to reflect correct model structure
4. **Fix navigation property usage**

#### **Option B: Update Models (Alternative)**
1. Add missing properties to models (like Equipment.Name, Equipment.SerialNumber)
2. Update database with migrations
3. This would require significant database changes

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Model Analysis** (1-2 hours)
- Document all model properties and relationships
- Create mapping between expected API structure and actual models

#### **Phase 2: API Controller Rewrite** (4-6 hours)
- Rewrite EquipmentApiController with correct Equipment model properties
- Rewrite MaintenanceLogApiController with correct MaintenanceLog structure
- Rewrite AlertApiController with correct Alert model
- Rewrite InventoryApiController with correct InventoryItem structure
- Fix AuthApiController to work with actual User model

#### **Phase 3: Testing** (2-3 hours)
- Build and test all API endpoints
- Create Postman collection for API testing
- Document API endpoints in Swagger

### üìã Current API Endpoints (Planned):

#### **Authentication API** (`/api/auth`)
- `POST /login` - User authentication
- `POST /register` - User registration  
- `POST /refresh` - Token refresh
- `GET /me` - Get current user
- `PUT /profile` - Update profile
- `POST /change-password` - Change password
- `POST /logout` - Logout

#### **Equipment API** (`/api/equipment`)
- `GET /` - List equipment (with filtering and pagination)
- `GET /{id}` - Get equipment by ID
- `POST /` - Create equipment
- `PUT /{id}` - Update equipment
- `DELETE /{id}` - Delete equipment
- `GET /{id}/maintenance-history` - Get maintenance history

#### **Maintenance Log API** (`/api/maintenancelog`)
- `GET /` - List maintenance logs
- `GET /{id}` - Get maintenance log by ID
- `POST /` - Create maintenance log
- `PUT /{id}` - Update maintenance log
- `DELETE /{id}` - Delete maintenance log
- `GET /statistics` - Maintenance statistics

#### **Alert API** (`/api/alert`)
- `GET /` - List alerts
- `GET /{id}` - Get alert by ID
- `POST /` - Create alert
- `PUT /{id}` - Update alert
- `PUT /{id}/resolve` - Resolve alert
- `DELETE /{id}` - Delete alert
- `GET /statistics` - Alert statistics
- `GET /dashboard` - Alert dashboard

#### **Inventory API** (`/api/inventory`)
- `GET /` - List inventory items
- `GET /{id}` - Get inventory item by ID
- `POST /` - Create inventory item
- `PUT /{id}` - Update inventory item
- `DELETE /{id}` - Delete inventory item
- `PUT /{id}/stock` - Update stock levels
- `GET /low-stock` - Get low stock items
- `GET /statistics` - Inventory statistics

### üöÄ Quick Win Alternative:

If time is limited, we could:
1. **Create a simple API status endpoint** to verify the infrastructure works
2. **Focus on one working API controller** (e.g., Equipment) with correct model mapping
3. **Document the API structure** for future development
4. **Move to next roadmap phase** (mobile app or advanced analytics)

### üìù Recommendation:

Given the complexity of the model mismatches, I recommend:
1. **Creating a simple health check API** to verify the infrastructure
2. **Moving to the next roadmap phase** (Advanced Analytics or Mobile App)
3. **Coming back to complete the API later** when we have more time

The SignalR, background services, and enhanced dashboard features are working well and provide significant value. The API can be completed in a future iteration.
